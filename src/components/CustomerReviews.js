      `I recently had my balcony cleaned with Tydee and simply put - incredible experience from start to finish. Communication was so quick and booking was super easy. Joel is extremely respectful of your space (and even brought shoes for indoor use only!). My balcony hadn't been cleaned since it was built so this was much needed - amazing and very thorough clean!! Would most definitely recommend as I'll be using these services again myself ðŸ˜€.`,

      `My husband and I moved into a two bedroom plus den. We both have hectic schedules and barely had time to unpack let alone clean. I have had awful experiences with cleaning companies so I was hesitant to drop a few hundred dollars. I reached out to Tydee, and was pleasantly surprised at how quick the communication was and easy to book. Our place was a mess when they arrived so I asked them to focus on the floors and bathrooms. Hours later, I came out of my office to a place I did not recognize. I was absolutely blown away at how tidy, clean and more importantly it felt like a home. They donâ€™t just do the bare minimum which was my issue with other cleaning companies. They are my go to now and will be cleaning my place on a regular basis.`,

      `Thank you! I would highly recommend hiring Tydee`,
